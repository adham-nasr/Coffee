# TASK 1

1) **Do small teams need to have version control systems like Git? Why or why not?**  
   From my experience, even when working on projects locally without cloud-based Git, using a version control system is essential. It helps track changes, makes it easier to roll back when necessary, and provides a safeguard against unexpected issues. This has saved me time and effort on multiple occasions, ensuring smooth progress.

2) **would you consider transitioning to an alternative system, such as Subversion or Perforce, if your team is currently using Git?**  
   In this assessment, I created separate repositories for the coffee and YouTube tasks. This is exactly the kind of issue the author highlights about using multiple repos for related projects. While Git is great for version control, I see the benefit of having more efficient tools for managing interdependent tasks, I would be eager to learn and exploring alternatives.

3) **What is your response to the argument the author presented in this article? Do you agree or disagree with the author when you are developing user interfaces?**  
   The author’s critique of “Electron.js” resonates with my own experience. As a web developer, I was initially drawn to Electron for my real-time dektop queueing system app due to its familiarity. However, I eventually opted for Flutter and Qt because of performance issues and high RAM consumption with Electron. This reinforces the author’s point about the drawbacks of using web-based tools for desktop applications.

4) **GUIs vs TUIs**  
   While TUIs are faster and more efficient, in my opinion, I believe GUIs are still the better choice for client-facing applications. GUIs, especially with visual elements like icons and buttons, are intuitive and easy to use, which is especially important for younger users. Additionally, with the right design, GUIs can help brands create a unique identity that resonates with customers. TUIs, on the other hand, are more suited for internal tools where efficiency and speed are prioritized over aesthetics.

5) **What do you think of the current state of web development and the increasing use of new frontend frameworks?**  
   Although frontend frameworks like React and Vue are gaining popularity due to their ability to speed up development, they often can't match the performance of native tools. However, when used with proper software design patterns, such as code splitting and lazy loading, modern frontend frameworks can offer a solid balance between performance and development speed. This allows for rapid development without compromising too much on user experience.
